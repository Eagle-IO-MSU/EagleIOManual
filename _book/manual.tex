If at some point Eagle I.O wishes to integrate within the broader MSU infrastructure, there are templates for doing so that exist at other Universities. Here is one recommended set of steps taken from the University of Texas:

Share the Organization's Structure: All students are required to write and submit a constitution. \href{https://www.utdallas.edu/soc/manual/04/\#leadership}{See Chapter Two for sample constitution}

\begin{itemize}
