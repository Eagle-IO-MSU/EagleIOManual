# Progression & Succession

![](images/replacements.PNG)

## Framework:  

+ Lens to get new mentees
+ Recruitment and selection
    + Marketing Officer responsible for sending out flyers about recruitment
    + When student wants to join outside of recruitment stage
        + Case should be discussed with all current members of Eagle I.O
+ All members identify possible Eagle I.O members 
+ Criteria: 
    + GPA
    + Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB's) and Counterproductive Work Behaviors (CWB's)
    + Involvement in Mentorship program
    + Involvement in attending events
    + Completed at least one semestre of the MSU I/O program
        + For both Masters' and PhD students

>  Note. I think we should add a section about a new member application. This section would highlight an application we create on qualtrics and our selection process for choosing the best EagleIO members

> Additional question - What is the plan for Ph.D. students and succession or holding a position? I believe we should discuss this with the full group

## Selection into formal roles:

+ New members nominate themselves and/or others for roles
+ Faculty member considers all nominations and makes final decision
+ Roles can be own by one member, or can be co-owned (should be determine with the amount of projects/responsibilities the role holds)
+ Role assignments will be discussed after the first-year students have shadowed for a semester (shadowing occurs during the Spring semester)
    + Shadowing = attending meetings

## Resignment and reassignment

+ Member are allowed to step down at any time
    + Including members holding specific titles
+ If member with title steps down, role must be reassigned effectively
    + Members nominate themselves/other
    + Faculty Advisor makes final decision
+ If member does not fulfill responsibilities of their role
    + Members should discuss issues together
    + Member should be given a timeline to pick up responsibilities
    + If member is unable to fulfill responsibilities, faculty advisor strips title and reassigns role


```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE}

library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

events <- read.csv("onboard.csv")

kable(events, "html", booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "6cm")

# events %>%
#  kable() %>%
#  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T)

```

## Opportunity for late admission

What to do if someone wants in "late"?

Currently Eagle I.O is limited to a maximum student size of 10.

If the current occupancy of Eagle I.O is less than 10, then there is a process to join:

Requirements:  

* 1 semester of enrollment within the MSU I/O Psychology program
* 3.8 GPA
* At least 1 semester remaining in the program
* An expressed interest

>Also, any Eagle I.O project is permitted to include the broader MSU I/O Psychology graduate student pool (if someone is interested in participating in projects but either is unable to join or Eagle I.O is currently "full")
