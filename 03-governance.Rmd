## Meetings - testing

All members are expected to participate for a minimum of 1.5 years (one Fall semester, two Spring semesters, and to be reasonably available over Winter and Summer breaks). 

* Time requirements of Eagle I.O members 
    + Meetings are mandatory - there is one excused absence per academic semester (Fall and Spring)
        + If you miss *more than one* meeting, and cannot call or make other arrangements for your virtual attendence, you will be put on probation (1 semester term) 
        + If you miss another meeting while on probation you will be expelled from Eagle I.O and fed to **Sir pSyCaDeLiCaT** in an agonizingly painful yet exceedingly beautiful ceremony
    + Keep track of the inbox *if you are the Parlimentarian*

## [Mentorship Program Management](https://bookdown.org/kulasj/mentoruser/)
* How to match mentors and mentees 
    + Revisit the method used to match and whether other factors should be considered
    + Form a survey team to create a qualtrics survey and perform the matching process
    + Work to match along 5 dimensions: 
        1. area of professional interest
        2. hometown
        3. undergrad major/minor
        4. part/full time, 
        5. academic/applied 
* Duration or partnership between mentee and mentor
    + The minimum mandatory term for each mentor/mentee partnership is one academic year (Fall through Spring)

> do we have mentorship program plans for Spring admits?
        
* Involvement of professors in mentor program beyond Dr. Kulas and Dr. Dan
    + Minimum of 3 meetings between mentors and mentees: 
        + Meeting 1: Individual Development Plan
        + Meeting 2: I/O related event
        + Meeting 3: formal/informal event 

## Consultant Development Plan 
* Either have each consultant discuss and fill out their own individual development plan in terms of Eagle I.O or have a development plan (filled out together) for the organization
    + Potential skills: professional, technical, or R-related skills
    + Meet with Kulas in *April of 1st year* to determine personal consultant goal that will be accomplished prior to graduation (in roughly 1 year)

> The development plan - maybe you could provide some insights on these.

## What to do for *Legitimacy*

> Legitimacy - like the development plan I'm not too sure we all know much about what this will entail. Probably would require more details about this from you. 

If at some point Eagle I.O wishes to integrate within the broader MSU infrastructure, there are templates for doing so that exist at other Universities. Here is one recommended set of steps taken from the University of Texas:

Share the Organizationâ€™s Structure: All students are required to write and submit a constitution. [See Chapter Two for sample constitution](https://www.utdallas.edu/soc/manual/04/#leadership)

+ Constitution and by-laws
+ Job descriptions/role classifications
+ Organizational goals and objectives
+ Status reports on ongoing projects
+ Evaluation of previous projects and programs
+ Resources and contact lists
+ Mailing lists
+ Historical records, scrapbooks, and equipment
