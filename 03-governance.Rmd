## Meetings

All members are expected to participate for a minimum of 1.5 years (one Fall semester, two Spring semesters, and to be reasonably available over Winter and Summer breaks). 

* Time requirements of Eagle I.O members 
    + Meetings are mandatory - there is one excused absence per academic semester (Fall and Spring)
        + If you miss *more than one* meeting, and cannot call or make other arrangements for your virtual attendence, you will be put on probation (1 semester term) 
        + If you miss another meeting while on probation you will be expelled from Eagle I.O and fed to **Sir pSyCaDeLiCaT** in an agonizingly painful yet exceedingly beautiful ceremony
    + Keep track of the inbox *if you are the Parlimentarian*

```

## Consultant Development Plan 

* Either have each consultant discuss and fill out their own individual development plan in terms of Eagle I.O or have a development plan (filled out together) for the organization
    + Potential skills: professional, technical, or R-related skills
    + Meet with Kulas in *April of 1st year* to determine personal consultant goal that will be accomplished prior to graduation (in roughly 1 year)

> The development plan - maybe you could provide some insights on these.

## Structure {#roles}

As of Spring Semester 2020, the formal roles of Eagle I.O are:

* Faculty roles:
    + Advisor (primary)
    + Advisor (mentorship)  
    

* Student roles:
    + Governance officer
    + Mentorship officer
    + Engagement officer
    + Marketing officer
    + Web officer
    + Parlimentarian 
    + R guru

The following chart is intended to estimate the amount of reliance of each role upon each other. Directionality is also indicated, but all of these numbers are mere esitmates.

Additional roles can be assigned on an as neded (e.g., project-by-project) basis. The primary responsibilities of these position holders is presented below. Note that elected officers and program managers always function as team leads - they are ultimately responsible for the listed information, but they are expected to execute tasks within teams:


```{r roles, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


together <- read.csv("temp.csv")
